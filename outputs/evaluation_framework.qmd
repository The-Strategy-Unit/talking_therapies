# Background

NHS Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression offers psychological support for common mental health problems. Examples of treatments include cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling.

Over the past decade, referrals to NHS Talking Therapies have increased from 1.1 million to 1.8 million. In 2023-24, 53% of referrals that started treatment completed a course of treatment. Completion of a course of treatment is defined as attending a minimum of two sessions (which can include psychological assessment and treatment).

Evidence provided in support of a 2023 funding bid to expand NHS Talking Therapies indicated that those who attend more sessions tend to report better outcomes. We use the term 'adherence' here to refer to patients engaging with NHS Talking Therapies treatment until a point where recovery is achieved.

The recovery standard for NHS Talking Therapies is that 50% of patients achieve reliable recovery. This standard is achieved by patients attending at least five treatment sessions, so our focus is on **reducing the proportion** of patients who complete a course of treatment, but **attend only two, three or four sessions**.

NHS England Behavioural Science Unit conducted a survey of NHS Talking Therapies practitioners to research reasons for non-adherence and suggested solutions. This identified two main themes: setting patient expectations and flexibility of service. Some responses indicated that local services are already implementing solutions that aim to set expectations, so that treatment starts positively.

The Behavioural Science Unit commissioned The Strategy Unit (NHS Midlands and Lancashire CSU) to evaluate the effectiveness of those solutions, to inform and develop guidance for services to increase adherence and improve patient outcomes.

### Hypotheses

The Behavioural Science Unit developed two hypotheses for the evaluation to explore:

1.  Some people who complete a course of NHS Talking Therapies treatment (defined as attending at least two sessions) stop treatment before they have done enough sessions to stand the best chance of recovering, because the treatment does not meet their prior expectations of what NHS Talking Therapies entail or what they will personally have to do as part of the treatment.

2.  If they were better informed before starting treatment about what Talking Therapies entail and what they will personally have to do as part of the treatment, they would be more likely to adhere to treatment until the point where they achieve recovery.

The survey found that some NHS Talking Therapies service providers have already implemented interventions to try to set realistic patient expectations before treatment. These include:

### Research questions

The Behavioural Science Unit developed two research questions for the evaluation to address:

-   Are these interventions effective (compared to doing nothing) in reducing the proportion of instances where NHS Talking Therapies clients complete a course of treatment, but end treatment after only two, three or four treatment sessions?

-   Can variations on these interventions (for example, to include behavioural insights) improve their effectiveness? The feasibility of answering this question within the time and resource available will be explored in scoping.

# Evaluation approach

## Work packages

The evaluation will be delivered through three interlinked work packages:

1.  **Scoping** - collaborative process to explore what methods are feasible and agree the Evaluation Framework and reporting timetable

2.  **Qualitative research** - to explore implementation and delivery of the interventions

3.  **Impact analysis** - to test whether any of the approaches have had an impact on the agreed outcomes

All reports will be written to a content plan and provided in a format agreed in advance with The Behavioural Science Unit, following our well-established quality assurance process.

### WP1: Scoping

The scoping phase will provide a detailed understanding of NHS Talking Therapies and ways to improve adherence. It will also explore feasible methods for both quantitative and qualitative research within the available resources.

Key steps:

**Inception meeting** to discuss the overall approach, review the scoping phase in detail and agree any necessary amendments. During this meeting the evaluation's aims will be confirmed, key stakeholders will be identified, and essential documents will be considered.

**A review of documents and literature** will be conducted to explore interventions designed to improve adherence to NHS Talking Therapies. This review will also include key sources and broader literature to help shape the evaluation design.

**Develop intervention typologies** by identifying a list of agreed interventions to explore. A decision will be made on which steps to prioritise, based on survey responses from NHS Talking Therapy practitioners. Similar interventions will be grouped into a shortlist of typologies, which will then be used for impact analysis.

**Good practice exmples will be identified** in collaboration with The Behavioural Science Unit to find providers that have implemented at least one of the agreed typologies. Engagement with the [FutureNHS community of practice](https://future.nhs.uk/NHSTalkingTherapies) will support this effort. Materials for contacting services and securing their participation will be agreed in advance.

**The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** will be carried out in coordination with NHS England (NHSE), acting as the Data Controller, to establish the information governance framework for the evaluation.

**Scoping interviews** with up to five key stakeholders to explore the background to the programme, as well as key questions for the evaluation and requirements for final outputs.

**The Data and Metrics Review** will involve an initial scoping process to assess which metrics are currently in place for the identified outcomes and explore potential sources for these metrics, as well as those that still need to be defined.

**An impact analysis feasibility assessment** will be conducted to determine the viability of an impact evaluation, including the most suitable methods. This will be a collaborative process to identify the most feasible and robust approach. The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) dataset will be reviewed to identify the required outcome variables, such as Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Additionally, the available variables will be examined to match case study providers with appropriate control providers. Stakeholder interviews and a literature review will help identify potential confounding factors. Data quality will be assessed to ensure that consistent information is available before and after the introduction of interventions aimed at improving adherence.

The final step will be **developing an evaluation framework**, working together to establish an agreed approach. This will outline the key lines of enquiry (KLoE) and the methods for addressing them. A detailed work plan for each work package will also be developed, including reporting requirements.

### WP2: Qualitative research

This outline will be reviewed and refined during the scoping stage.

Qualitative research will explore the processes involved in delivering the case study interventions. Interviews will examine local delivery models, barriers and enablers to progress, improvements that have been made, and staff perspectives on what works and why.

To support this research, **data collection tools will be developed**, including topic guides and participant information sheets, which will be created and agreed upon with The Behavioural Science Unit.

**Staff interviews** will be conducted remotely with two key stakeholders from case study services across the typology. The cost estimates assume ten case studies, though alternative approaches could include a single interview with 20 services or a combination of interview and a proforma or survey to collect data on improvements and their implementation. These options will be discussed during the scoping phase.

**Qualitative data will be coded** using NVivo software, following an established and best-practice approach that has been quality assured by the NHSE analytical team. All interviews will be recorded with participant consent and transcribed verbatim.

Finally, the **interview data will be analysed** using the Key Lines of Enquiry (KLoE) as a framework to ensure a structured and meaningful evaluation.

### WP3: Impact analysis

This outline will be reviewed and refined during the scoping stage.

The impact analysis will focus on capturing and evaluating data to assess the effectiveness of different approaches to improving adherence to NHS Talking Therapies.

To achieve this, **data will be sourced** from the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) dataset via the Unified Data Access Layer (UDAL) platform. The data will be organised by provider, checked for quality, and used to calculate outcome variables. Once prepared, aggregate data will be processed in RStudio for analysis.

A **quasi-experimental study design** will be applied to assess whether any of the interventions have led to improvements in adherence. Ideally, this method will compare outcomes from case study providers with similar providers before and after the intervention. A matched difference-in-difference design would be the preferred approach, but its feasibility will need to be tested during the scoping phase. A detailed description of the methodology will also be developed during this phase.

The process of data wrangling and analysis will be conducted using the R programming language, with all code shared via GitHub to ensure transparency and accessibility.

## Report writing

A summative report will be produced at the end of the evaluation.

**Draft report**. The reporting process will begin with a draft report that provides a detailed narrative, capturing insights from NHS Talking Therapies case study sites. It will explore what works and why, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative findings. The report will follow an agreed content plan and a format agreed in advance.

**Revisions and final draft**. Following the draft, two rounds of revisions will be included to incorporate feedback from The Behavioural Science Unit and key stakeholders. The final report will feature a stand-alone executive summary to ensure key findings are easily accessible.

### About Talking Therapies

> In 2023 the IAPT programme was renamed NHS Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression to facilitate public recognition and clarify the clinical conditions that are treated in the services.

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

> At the time of publication (2018), nine out of ten people are seen within 6 weeks of referral.

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

> Services are delivered using a stepped-care model, which works according to the principle that people should be offered the least intrusive intervention appropriate for their needs.
>
> Many people with less severe depression or anxiety disorders are likely to benefit from a course of low-intensity treatment delivered by a psychological well-being practitioner (PWP). Individuals who do not fully recover at this level should be stepped up to a course of hihg-intensity treatment. NICE guidance recommends that people with more severe dpression and those with social anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should receive high-intensity interventions from the outset

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

> NHS England have set the following targets for Talking Therapy services:
>
> -   Recovery: 50% of eligible referrals should recover following a course of treatment
>
> -   Waiting times: 75% of new referrals to Talking Therapy services should enter treatment within 6 weeks, and 95% within 18 weeks
>
> -   Access: The expansion of Talking Therapies services aims to provide at least 1.5m adults with access to care each year by 2020/21. This means that services will move from seeing around 15% of all people with anxiety and depression each year to 25%, and all areas will have more services.

#### Notes on terminology:

##### Caseness

> NB, `caseness` is the term used to describe a referral that scores highly enough on measures of depression and/or anxiety to be classed as a clinical case. It is measured by using the assessment scores collected at Talking Therapies care contacts. If a patient's score is above the clinical / non-clinical cut off (also known as the 'caseness threshold') on either anxiety, depression or both, then the referral is classed as a clinical case.

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

##### Recovery

> Recovery in Talking Therapies is measured in terms of 'caseness' - a term which means a referral has severe enough symptoms of anxiety or depression to be regarded as a clinical case of that condition. A referral has moved to recovery if they were defined as a clinical case at the start of their treatment ('at caseness') and not as a clinical case at the end of the treatment, measured by scores from patient questionnaires tailored to their specific condition.
>
> This measure is technically defined as a count of the number of referrals that ended in the period having finished a course of treatment, and where the following is true:
>
> -   there are two or more PHQ-9 scores and two or more ADSM scores (known as 'paired scores')
>
> -   where one or both of their first scores are above the relevant caseness threshold
>
> -   both of the last scores are below the relevant caseness thresholds.

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

##### Reliable improvement

> A referral has shown reliable improvement if there is a clinically significant improvement in their condition following a course of treatment, measured by the difference between their first and last scores on patient questionnaires tailored to their specific condition.
>
> The measure is technically defined as a count of the number of referrals that ended in the period having finished a course of treatment, and where the following are true:
>
> -   there are two or more PHQ-9 scores and two or more ADSM scores (known as 'paired scores')
>
> -   where there is a **decrease** from the first to the last score on either the PHQ-9 or the ADSM measure, or both, that is greater than the reliable change threshold for that measure
>
> -   **neither** the PHQ-9 measure nor the ADSM measure has an **increase** from the first to the last score that is greater than the reliable change threshold for that measure.

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

##### Reliable recovery

> A referral has reliable recovered if they meet the criteria for both the recovery and reliable improvement measures. That is, they have moved from being a clinical case at the start of treatment to not being a clinical case at the end of treatment, and there has also been a clinically significant improvmenet in their condition.
>
> This measure is technically defined as the number of referrals that ended in the month having finished a course of treatment, and where the following are true:
>
> -   there are two or more PHQ-9 scores and two or more ADSM scores (known as 'paired scores')
>
> -   where one or both of their first scores are above the relevant caseness threshold
>
> -   both of their last scores are below the relevant caseness thresholds
>
> -   where there is a **decrease** from the first to the last score on **either** the PHQ-9 measure or the ADSM measure, or both, that is **greater** than the reliable change threshold for that measure
>
> -   **neither** the PHQ-9 measure nor the ADSM measure has an **increase** from the first the first to the last score that is **greater** than the reliable change threshold for that measure

##### Combining improvement and recovery measures

> Reliable improvement and recovery can be combined to create and overall measure of reliable recovery - a count of those referrals who show both a change from caseness to not being caseness during the referral and which show a reliable improvement in their score(s).
>
> Combining the two measures also allows examination of the outcomes for the 'borderline' referrals, such as those which showed recovery with no improvement, or those which did not show recovery but did show improvement. In some cases, it is even possible for an individual to show recovery but also deteriorate when evaluating the PHQ-9 and ADSM.

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

##### Waiting times

> Waiting times to first treatment care contact are measured simply as the number of days between the referral received and the first, attended treatment care contact date.
>
> In publications, waiting times are based on two different cohorts of patients:
>
> -   referrals entering treatment in the period
>
> -   referrals finishing a course of treatment in the period

[NHS Talking Therapies manual v7.1](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nhs-talking-therapies-manual-v7.1.pdf)

##### Finishing a course of treatment

> This is the count of referrals with an end date in the period having two or more attended treatment care contacts between the referral received date and referral end date.
>
> In IAPT v2.0 dataset this measure has been updated to exclude Employment Support (Employment Advisers programme) care contacts.
